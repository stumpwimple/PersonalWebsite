                    I am an aspiring web developer. I have spent a decade in the construction industry working in 2D and
                    3D
                    Drafting, Construction Technologies, Project Estimating and Project Management.
                    I am a long time gaming enthusiast. I grew up enjoying card games(52) and classic board games with
                    family. I was
                    Tails (using a beat up atari controller) to my brothers Sonic. Planeswalking Dominaria since the Ice
                    Ages, I
                    have been rolling dice since the 3/3.5, and have been mastering games just as long. I dabble in 3D

                    <br>
                    I began programming in True BASIC in junior high and have had hobby projects in c#, excel, c++,
                    Visual Basic, Python and more. Have developed hobby projects First Person, Puzzle, top-down and VR
                    using the
                    Unity platform.
                    I look forward to learning and expanding my programming skill set.
                    <br>
                    I am enthusiastic about Generating deeply immersive universes, Zero Energy Homes, and making the
                    world a better
                    place.
